CVSTrac2Trac

CVSTrac is undergoing ever less frequent updates and becoming a stale
project.  Moreover, a software project management platform that is
based on compiled C code is not always convenient for modern server
infrastructures.  However, there are few tools to help facilitate a
migration to Trac, which is a much more widely used and heavily
supported (as of 2012) tool.

This will serve as a collection of tools to support such migration.
